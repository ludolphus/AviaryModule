#Aviary iphone module for Titanium Mobile

##Requirements

- Titanium Mobile SDK 3.2.0GA.
- iOS SDK 6.0+
- AviarySDK Version 4.2.0

Because of GitHub max file size issues (100MB) the source no longer includes the AviarySDK framework. It is included in the module zip. Also make sure to update the .bundle located in the module folder.

##Installation for iOS
- Download AviaryModule project
- Build your module from Terminal via "./build.py"
- Extract and copy the module in your project under /modules/iphone/ or just copy the zip file and have it auto-uncompress 
- Add the following in your tiapp.xml like below:

```
<modules>
   <module platform="iphone" version="4.1.0">com.ghkim.aviary</module>
</modules>
```

* Make sure you add in the *AviarySDKResources.bundle* (located in the module folder), to your project files or it won't work! 
  * Add it in **/platform/iphone/** and it will compile in during the build. Clean the project just in case.
